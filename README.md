# Heart-Disease-Prediction-System
Heart disease prediction, a complex medical task, leverages data science to manage vast health data and automate risk assessments. This project uses machine learning techniques like LDA, QDA, KNN, SVM, RF, and GBM to predict heart disease and analyze algorithm performance in categorizing patient risk levels.
Heart disease prediction remains one of the most challenging tasks in the medical field today. Each minute, heart disease claims a life, underscoring the critical role of data science in managing the vast amounts of healthcare data. Given the complexity of predicting heart disease, there is a pressing need to automate the process to mitigate risks and provide early warnings to patients. Heart diseases have consistently been a leading cause of mortality, influenced by behavioral risk factors such as unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, and excessive alcohol consumption. These behaviors may manifest as increased blood pressure, elevated blood glucose levels, high blood lipids, and obesity. The primary objective of this project is to ascertain the presence of heart disease in patients using various attributes. This research also aims to estimate the likelihood of heart disease and categorize patients' risk levels through the application of diverse techniques including Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM). Additionally, it presents a detailed comparative analysis of the performance of these machine learning algorithms.
